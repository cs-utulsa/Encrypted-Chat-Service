# Encrypted-Chat-Service
Uses 3 classes for basic chat functionality. They are chat, client and server
* The client class is used to attempt to directly connect to another host.
* The server class is for listening on a port for a connection to be made.
* The chart class drives the application. It utulizes client and server to establish a connection, then runs the chat session.

Future classes & functionality will be added.  
  
Currently, this application is not encrypted and runs in the console. It is the baseline for future features. This readme is for the production branch, which is only for code that is fully written and tested.
